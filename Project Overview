Air Quality Monitoring System Project
Project Overview
The Air Quality Monitoring System (AQMS) aims to measure and assess various pollutants present in the air to determine the quality of the air in a specific area or region. The system gathers data on pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This information is essential for safeguarding public health, protecting the environment, and promoting sustainable development.

Project Structure
The project will be divided into several components:

Data Collection: Deploy sensors to collect air quality data.
Data Transmission: Send collected data to a central server.
Data Storage: Store the data in a database.
Data Analysis: Analyze the data to assess air quality.
Data Visualization: Display the air quality information on a dashboard.
Alerts and Notifications: Provide alerts if pollutant levels exceed safe limits.
Tools and Technologies
Hardware: Air quality sensors (e.g., MQ series sensors, PM2.5 sensors)
Software: Python, Flask, React.js, PostgreSQL
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, SQLAlchemy
Testing: Pytest, unittest
Version Control: Git, GitHub
