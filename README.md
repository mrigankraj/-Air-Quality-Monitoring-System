# Air Quality Monitoring System

## Overview
The Air Quality Monitoring System (AQMS) is designed to measure and assess air quality by collecting data on various pollutants. This system helps in identifying potential health risks and taking necessary measures to mitigate the impacts of poor air quality.

## Features
- Real-time data collection using sensors
- Data transmission to a central server
- Data storage in a PostgreSQL database
- Data analysis and visualization
- Alerts and notifications for high pollutant levels
